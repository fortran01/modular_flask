# modular-flask

This project serves as a guide to modular architecture in back-end development, with practical examples demonstrated using the Python programming language and the Flask framework. It provides in-depth discussions of key concepts and patterns, such as the Script Pattern vs. Domain Model, various types of models in back-end systems, and the role of services in mapping requests to responses. Additionally, it covers service development techniques, dependency injection, serialization/deserialization processes, and modern development techniques like debugging, all within the context of Python and Flask. By the end of this project, participants will gain a thorough understanding of how to design and implement maintainable, scalable, and robust back-end systems using these modular architecture principles, as exemplified through Python and Flask.
